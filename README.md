Key insights:
-->About 65% of our customers are women—they really love our stuff!
-->Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh made up 35% of our sales—they're our stars.
-->Young adults, aged 21 to 35, are our big spenders, making up half of our sales.
-->Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra are where the action is—contributing a whopping 80% of our sales.

So, to boost sales, let's focus on advertising and special offers for women aged 21 to 35 in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. We can do this through Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra where we've had the most success.

🙏 I'd like to extend my gratitude to Rishabh Mishra sir for his valuable guidance and process of creating reports.
